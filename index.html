    <h2 class="red">Sport Cars</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance,
      such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and
      racing capability. Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1902 and are
      currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.

      Soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who
      primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field
      called a pitch. Some of my favourite teams are

    <h2 class="purple">Music</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In the most general of terms, music is the arrangement of sound to create
      some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive
      content. Definitions of music vary depending on culture, though it is an
      aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal.
